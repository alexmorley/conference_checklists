## Conference Poster Checklist
#### General
- [ ] Are all of my co-authors names spelt correctly?
- [ ] Are my institutional/funders logo's present where required?

#### Aesthetic
- [ ] Have I printed to scale to check everything is a reasonable size?
- [ ] Is everything aligned properly?
- [ ] Have I used too many colours (<5 ideal)?
- [ ] Have I used too many typefaces (<2 ideal)?
- [ ] Have I used too much text (should be mostly labels and perhaps a few bullet-points)?
- [ ] Do I have a plain background?
- [ ] Have I shown it to a mentor/colleague to get feedback **while there is still time to do something about it!**

#### DataViz
- [ ] Have I used any 3D graphs, do they really add any interpretable information?
- [ ] Are **all of my axes labelled correctly**?
- [ ] Double check axes are all labelled correctly.

#### Final Tips
Remember **your poster is an advertisement** for a piece of research. You just need to show enough to explain to someone what you have found. Anything else can be discussed or shared later.
